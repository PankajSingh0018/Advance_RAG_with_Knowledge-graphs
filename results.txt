Document: balanced diet is one which includes a variety of foods in adequate amounts and correct proportions to meet the day’s requirements of all essential nutrients such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, water, and fibre. Such a diet helps to promote and preserve good health and also provides a safety margin or reserve of nutrients to withstand short durations of deprivation when they are not supplied by the diet. The safety margin takes care of the days we fast, or the short-term deficiency of certain nutrients in the daily diet. If the balanced diet meets the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for an individual, then the safety margin is already included since RDAs are formulated keeping extra allowances in mind. Recommended Dietary Allowances = Requirements + Margin of safety A balanced diet takes care of the following aspects. 1. Includes a variety of food items 2. Meets the RDA for all nutrients 3.

Maintains acceptable body weight for height 3.3 Health and Fitness According to World Health Organisation (WHO) ‘‘Health is the state of complete physical, emotional, and social well-being, not merely the absence of diseases or infirmity.’’ This definition has remained unchanged since 1948. All of us want to maintain positive health, i.e., a perfect blend of physical, social and mental. Taking adequate amounts of essential nutrients in our diet is necessary to maintain positive health. Physical health is probably the most easily understood aspect. Mental health can be defined as a state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use her or his cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life. In other words, the absence of a recognised mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health. One way to assess mental health is to see how effectively and successfully a person functions. Feeling capable and competent, being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintaining satisfying relationships, and leading an independent life; and being able to ‘bounce back’ or recover from difficult situations are all signs of good mental health. Physical fitness is good bodily health; it is the result of regular exercise, proper diet and nutrition, and proper rest for physical recovery. The term physical fitness is used in two ways: general fitness (a state of health and well-being) and specific fitness (a task-oriented definition based on the ability to perform specific aspects of sports or occupations). Physical fitness is the capacity of the heart, blood vessels, lungs, and muscles to function at optimal efficiency. Earlier, fitness

Document: Human Ecology and Family Sciences – Part I283Food, Nutrition, Health and Fitness 3.1 Introduction The onset of adolescence brings with it many profound changes. The growth rate speeds up dramatically. This growth spurt occurs due to the activity of hormones that affect every organ of the body and this makes healthy eating very important. The nutrient needs rise throughout childhood, peak in adolescence and then level off or even diminish as the teenager becomes an adult. The saying ‘‘You are what you eat” seems to be proven true. We eat different kinds of food such as dal, chapatti, bread, rice, vegetables, milk, lassi, etc. All these different kinds of food provide us with nutrients to keep us healthy and active. It is important to know what food to eat in order to stay healthy. The science of food and nutrients and their action on our health is called Nutrition.Learning Objectives After completing this chapter the learner will be able to — • define the terms — food, nutrition, nutrients, health, fitness and the role of food and nutrition in maintaining health. • understand the term, balanced diet and apply the concept in planning and consuming diets. • understand the basis for defining the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) and the difference between Dietary Requirement and RDA. • understand the basis for classifications of foods into appropriate groups. • analyse the factors which influence adolescent food habits. • identify the causes, symptoms and nutritional interventions related to eating disorders. Unit 1.indd 28 8/4/2022 2:50:43 PM 2024-25 29Nutrition and health, in fact, are two sides of the same coin. They are, therefore, inseparable. Health depends to a large extent on nutrition, and nutrition depends on the food intake. So food, is the most important single factor for health and fitness. Let us define and describe food, nutrition, health and fitness • Food can be defined as anything solid or liquid which when swallowed, digested and assimilated in the body provides it with essential substances called nutrients and keeps it well. It is the basic necessity of life. Food supplies energy, enables growth and repair of tissues and organs. It also protects the body from disease and regulates body functions. • Nutrition is defined as the science of foods, nutrients and other substances they contain; and of their actions within the body including ingestion, digestion, absorption, metabolism and excretion. While this summarises the physiological dimensions, nutrition has social, psychological and economic dimensions too. • Nutrients are the constituents in food that must be supplied to the body in suitable amounts. These include carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, vitamins, water and fibre. We need a wide range of nutrients to keep ourselves healthy. Most foods contain more than one nutrient such as milk has proteins, fats, etc. Nutrients can be classified as macronutrients and micronutrients on the basis of the required quantity to be consumed by us everyday. The figure on the next page shows us the distinction between macronutrients and micronutrients. 3.2 Balanced Diet A
